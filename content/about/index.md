## About SVNA

The Santiago Villa Residents' Association (SVRA) was started by Barbara Davis, Trey Bornmann, and Bee Hanson. The current organization was started in 2015, but there have been other informal residents organizations. We still have some typewritten directories from those early years.

SVRA was started by by compiling a directory of neighbors, and in 2017, our membership was big enough to apply for and receive a grant from the City of Mountain View. At that time, our Residents' Association became the Santiago Villa Neighborhood Association (SVNA).

Since 2018, we have used our grant money to hold events like a summer barbecue, ice cream socials, Hallowe'en and Thanksgiving events, and to publish newsletters and a website. Last year, we started a popular new tradition -- the Coffee Klatsch, which depending on the weather, is usually held on the first Saturday of each month. 

### Annual BBQ

Before Covid, our most popular neighborhood activity was our summer barbecue. We held our first one at the clubhouse in 2018, and it was attended by more than 100 of our residents. Our second one was even more popular. The pandemic put a two-year hold on that annual event, but we hope fire up the grill again in 2025.

### Meetings in the Clubhouse

Before the pandemic, we held neighborhood meetings in the clubhouse once a month. This year, some of our grant money went to a Zoom membership, so we can continue to have meetings online no matter what the Coronavirus does next. We'll meet in person soon, but we might also add virtual meetings from time to time.

## How is SVNA Organized?

The five-member SVNA Board is elected annually. We have an "Election by Acclamation," if the officers run unopposed.

We'll be having an election for SVNA officers in July. If you like hanging out with a bunch of cool people and doing some good for your neighbors, send email to board@santiagovilla.org.

Our current President is Bee Hanson, one of the original founders of the SVRA, and steadfast recorder of all SVNA and Mountain View Mobile Home Association (MVMHA) activities. Bee has lived in the neighborhood since 1996, and is looking forward to many more years here.

### SVNA's Nonprofit Status

In 2020, Trey Bornmann set up SVNA as a nonprofit \[501 (c) (3)], which means our association is now a service organization. Trey also wrote the initial version of the association bylaws. You can read the latest update here.

Bee Hanson wrote the Letter of Certification that describes the SVNA's mission as a service organization, and Trey provided most of the legal documentation.

Soon, we will be able to solicit donations from organizations whose interests in North Bayshore coincide with our own. But that's something we won't be doing until we have a specific objective, and that might be far in the future.

### Our Financial Status

In 2017, SVNA qualified to receive an annual neighborhood association support grant from the City of Mountain View in the amount of $1800. We used those funds to get our association started with a range of neighborhood activities. The annual support grant was increased the following year to $2000. Because of the impact on the City of the COVID-19 pandemic, the current grant gradually decreased, and is now $904 annually.

## What Does SVNA Do?

The mission of the Santiago Villa Neighborhood Association, as stated in our bylaws, is "to promote and advance neighborhood goals and to preserve and enhance the welfare of the neighborhood."

We spend a lot of time doing that at City Council meetings, and occasionally we deliver informative flyers. Over the years, We have worked on neighborhood safety, including earthquake and fire preparedness and home security, but we need to revisit those efforts. Occasionally we organize presentations at our clubhouse from the Mountain View Fire and Police departments. And we bring in developers who explain their plans for North Bayshore.

Over the years, the SVNA Board has maintained good relationships with, and received support from, our neighbors in the North Bayshore neighborhood: Google, Microsoft, Eden Housing, Syweat, and the Pear Village developer, The Sobrato Organization. Because we need to be sure that developers will consider our welfare as they change our neighborhood, we believe that maintaining our relationships with our corporate neighbors is one of our most important responsibilities.
