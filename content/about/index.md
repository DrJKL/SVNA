## About SVNA

The Santiago Villa Residents' Association (SVRA) was started by Alex Brown, Bee Hanson, Barbara Davis, Stuart Esbit, and Trey Bornmann. The current organization was started in 2015, but there have been other informal residents organizations. We still have some typewritten directories and a few documents about the activities of those organizations from those early years.

SVRA was started by compiling a directory of neighbors, and in 2017, our membership was big enough to apply for and receive a grant from the City of Mountain View. At that time, our Residents' Association became the Santiago Villa Neighborhood Association (SVNA).

Since 2018, we have used our grant money to hold events like a summer barbecue, ice cream socials, Hallowe'en and Thanksgiving events, and to publish newsletters and a website. Last year, Tich Jones started a popular new tradition -- the Coffee Klatsch, which depending on the weather, is usually held on the first Saturday of each month. It has become a roaring success.

### Annual BBQ

Before Covid, our most popular neighborhood activity was our summer barbecue. We held our first one at the clubhouse in 2018, and it was attended by more than 100 of our residents. Our second one was even more popular. The pandemic put a two-year hold on that annual event, but intend to fire up the grill again soon.

### Meetings in the Clubhouse

Before the pandemic, we held neighborhood meetings in the clubhouse once a month. This year, we're finally back to meeting in person, so we're having two General Meetings in the clubhouse, in addition to other events. 

## How is SVNA Organized?

The five-member SVNA Board is elected annually. If the officers run unopposed, we will have an election by acclimation.

The election for SVNA officers takes place in July. If you like hanging out with a bunch of cool people and doing some good for your neighbors, send email to board@santiagovilla.org.

Our current President is Bee Hanson, one of the original founders of the SVRA, and steadfast recorder of all SVNA and Mountain View Mobile Home Association (MVMHA) activities. Bee has lived in the neighborhood since 1996, and is looking forward to many more years here.

### SVNA's Nonprofit Status

In 2020, Trey Bornmann set up SVNA as a nonprofit \[501 (c) (3)], which means our association is now a service organization. Trey also wrote the initial version of the association bylaws.

Bee Hanson wrote the Letter of Certification that describes the SVNA's mission as a service organization, and Trey provided most of the legal documentation, which she now manages as President.

Soon, we will be able to solicit donations from organizations whose interests in North Bayshore coincide with our own. But that's something we won't be doing until we have a specific objective, and that might be far in the future.

### Our Financial Status

In 2017, SVNA qualified to receive an annual neighborhood association support grant from the City of Mountain View in the amount of $1800. We used those funds to get our association started with a range of neighborhood activities. The annual support grant was increased the following year to $2000. But because of the impact on the City of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the addition of many more neighborhood organizations, the current grant gradually decreased, and is now $904 annually.

## What Does SVNA Do?

The mission of the Santiago Villa Neighborhood Association, as stated in our bylaws, is "to promote and advance neighborhood goals and to preserve and enhance the welfare of the neighborhood."

We spend a lot of time doing that at City Council meetings, and we regularly send newsletters and sometimes deliver informative flyers. Over the years, We have worked on neighborhood safety, including earthquake and fire preparedness and home security, but we need to revisit those efforts. Occasionally we organized presentations at our clubhouse from the Mountain View Fire and Police departments, and might do that again. And we often bring in developers who explain their plans for North Bayshore.

Over the years, the SVNA Board has maintained good relationships with, and received support from, our neighbors in the North Bayshore neighborhood: Google, Microsoft, Eden Housing, Sywest, and the Sobrato Organization, the Pear Village developer. Because we need to be sure that developers will consider our welfare as they change our neighborhood, we believe that maintaining our relationships with our corporate neighbors is one of our most important responsibilities.
