## City Council & RHC Meetings

On October 28, 2021, the Mountain View City Council finally enacted the Mountain View Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Ordinance. City Councilmembers who helped us enact the ordinance ran for re-election and won!

Alison Hicks, Lucas Ramirez, Pat Showalter, and Ellen Kamei are still our champions on City Council. Sally Lieber had to resign, but our friend Emily Ramos was appointed to complete her term.
