      <description>What is the SVNA? The Santiago Villa Neighborhood Association (SVNA) was started in 2015 as the Santiago Villa Residents Association (SVRA), a directory of our neighbors in the Santiago Villa mobile and manufactured home community in Mountain View.&#xA;In the spring of 2016, Barbara Davis, Trey Bornmann, and Bee Hanson began using the directory to organize a response to unexpected and unusually high space rent increases (between 5% and 10%), which were causing a serious hardship for many of our community&amp;rsquo;s residents.</description>
